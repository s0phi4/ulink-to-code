# ULink to Code

An app that allows you to organize your coding learning resources (Youtube videos, articles)
I came up with this idea because I felt overwhelmed with all the links shared and I wanted to have a way to save them under categories.

## Links to Repos and wireframe
- [API Repo](https://github.com/yenpraja610/yenproject)
- [ULink to Code](http://yenpraja.codes/ulink-to-code/)
- [Wireframe](http://i1172.photobucket.com/albums/r579/yenlumiere610/Mobile%20Uploads/9AF1E1AE-8A16-412B-B296-BE07E5959CCB_zpscbzigqvn.jpg)

## Userstories
- As a user I want to login and see three categories under which I can save links of resources I use to learn code.
- As a user I want to save a learning resource with a name , url, tag, and content-type to have an organized list  of resources I use to learn code.
- As a user I want to update the resources I have saved. I want to keep my links up to date and rename them.

## Resources used

- Handlebars
- Bootstrap
- javascript


## Struggles

- Bootstrap: Modals.
- Lack of a more methodical process.


## How to improve
- In order to improve the process I need to build checklists that allow me to have an organized process when writing code.(Ex: Create, element, create click handler, console.log to test, etc)
- Use a form in a popover that indicates the tag name, so there is a hidden tag field in the form and have the info added in the table.
- Filter links by tag name.
